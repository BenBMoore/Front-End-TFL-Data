# Front-End-TFL-Data
A simple website to display the TFL Data, utilising leaflet and flask

Ensure Flask is installed, and then run main.py. Will only work with database from TFL-Open-Data-Processor.

## TODO
- Automate deployment.
- Move to hosted database.
- Experiement with different map libraries (mapbox, openlayers)
